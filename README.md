# Zero Day Repo
This is my first repository as a full-stack engineer

## 0x00-vagrant
This was my first tryout with Vagrant.
Vagrant is attached to VirtualBox to allow me run Ubuntu Focal

#### Starting Vagrant
It is quite easy. All you have to do is open the terminal (or command prompt in Windows) and type in this command: `$ vagrant up`. That command will fire up Vagrant afterwhich you need to ssh into the Ubuntu OS: `$ vagrant ssh`

The Ubuntu OS terminal will be loaded up to take in your inputs. When you're done, all you have to do is type: `$ exit` hit enter and it takes you out of the Ubuntu OS/terminal but you will need to kill/stop Vagrant from running. To do that, type this: `$ vagrant halt`
